		Solution="Anna Taylor was president of the Bridge Club, but also a terrible player. Her partner, Rose Butterfly, is a true competitor. To stop Anna from participating in the tournament (and therefore to get a new partner) Rose offered Anna a cake with a trace of digitalis, hoping to make her temporarily sick. But Anna wasn't young anymore, and her body couldn't support the quantity of the digitalis found in the cake. Nor could her cats, by the way. Rose, on the other hand, will be able to start her own Bridge club... in prison."

		ContinueInvestigation="The Chief Officer doesn't believe your theory. He would like you to continue your investigation. Find the crime weapon and who could have used it."
