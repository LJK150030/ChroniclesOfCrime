		Solution="Here is a recap of what happened. Anna Taylor was president of the Bridge Club, but also a terrible player. Her partner, Rose Butterfly, is a real competitor. To stop Anna from participating in the tournament (and therefore to get a new partner), Rose offered Anna a cake with a trace of digitalis, hoping to make her temporarily sick. But Anna wasn't young anymore, and her body couldn't support the quantity of the digitalis found in the cake. Nor could her cats, by the way. Rose, on the other hand, will be able to start her own Bridge club... in prison."
